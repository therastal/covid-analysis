## Problem Statement
- Which Regions handled COVID-19 the best assuming our metrics are change in GDP by percentage and COVID-19 infection rate per capita. (Jan 1 2020 - Oct
31 2020)
- Find the top 5 pairs of countries that share a land border and have the highest discrepancy in covid-19 infection rate per capita. Additionally find the top 5
landlocked countries that have the highest discrepancy in covid-19 infection rate per capita.
- Live update by Region of current relevant totals from COVID-19 data.
- Is the trend of the global COVID-19 discussion going up or down? Do spikes in infection rates of the 5-30 age range affect the volume of discussion?
- When was COVID-19 being discussed the most?
- What percentage of countries have an increasing COVID-19 Infection rate?
- What are the hashtags used to describe COVID-19 by Region (e.g. #covid, #COVID-19, #Coronavirus, #NovelCoronavirus)? Additionally what are the top 10
commonly used hashtags used alongside COVID hashtags?
- Is there a significant relationship between a Regionâ€™s cumulative GDP and Infection Rate per capita? What is the average amount of time it took for each region
to reach its first peak in infection rate per capita?
